# Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) is popular segmentation

"
Recency: The number of time units that have passed since the customer
last purchased. Open Question: How recently did the customer purchase?

Frequency: The average number of purchases per time unit. Again,
the metric can be measured directly in units or scores.
Open Question: How often do they purchase?

Monetary: The total dollar amount spent per time unit. The monetary
metric is typically measured by using intervals or scores.
Open Question: How much do they spend (each time on average)?
